Projects I've been working on during my ML masterclass training and while taking some online courses. 


**Patent Abstracts RNN:** Building and training recurrent neural network which is able to generate patent abstracts in the field of 
neural science and AI.

**Energy Score Prediction:** Using various regression (and classification) models on a pretty messy dataset to predict the energy score of huge number of NYC housings. Here, ML models are not only used to make predictions, but to also fix some inconsistencies inherent in the dataset.

**Haberman's Brest Cancer Prediction:** Using various classification models on a highly imbalanced dataset to pretict the outcome 
of a brest cancer operation. 

**CiFAR 10 CNN:** Building and training a simple CNN architecture for CiFAR image classification. 

**Spam or Ham NLP:** Uisng a natural language processing techniques and training the Multinomial Naive Bayes classificator on a set of SMS, we build a model which tries to predict whether a given SMS is spam or a regular message (ham).
