Projects I've been working on during my ML masterclass training and while taking some online courses. 


**Patent Abstracts RNN:** Building and training recurrent neural network which is able to generate patent abstracts in the field of 
neural science and AI.

**Energy Score Prediction:** Using various regression (and classification) models on a pretty messy dataset to predict the energy score of huge number of NYC housings. Here, ML models are not only used to make predictions, but to also fix some inconsistencies inherent in the dataset.

**Haberman's Brest Cancer Prediction:** Using various classification models on a highly imbalanced dataset to pretict the outcome 
of a brest cancer operation.

**Movie Recommendations with Sparse Autoencoder:** Building an autoencoder to recommend movies based on a previous movie ratings given by a user.

**Movie Recommendations with Restricted Boltzmann Machine:** Building a Boltzmann machine based model to recommend movies based on a previous movie ratings given by a user.

**LeNet Traffic Sign Classification:** Building and training a simple LeNet based CNN architecture for traffic sign image classification.

**CiFAR 10 CNN:** Building and training a simple CNN architecture for CiFAR image classification. 

**Credit Card Fraud Detection With SOM and ANN:** Using a self-organizing map we make a model able to discern an unusal behaviour among bank customers, and target potencial credit card abuse. In addition, we train a simple artificial neural network to predict the probabilities of the abuse actually happening.
