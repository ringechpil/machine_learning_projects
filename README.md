Projects I've been working on during my ML masterclass training.


**Patent Abstracts RNN:** Building and training recurrent neural network which is able to generate patent abstracts in the field of 
neural science and AI.

**Energy Score Prediction:** Using various regression (and classification) models to predict the energy score of huge number of NYC housings. 
Here, ML models are not only used to make predictions, but to also fix some inconsistencies inherent in the dataset.

**Haberman's Brest Cancer Prediction :** Using various classification models on a highly imbalanced dataset to pretict the outcome 
of a brest cancer operation.
